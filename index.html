		<p>Frey died Monday of complications from rheumatoid arthritis, acute ulcerative colitis and pneumonia in New York at age 67. 
		He was born in Detroit and formed the band with Don Henley in 1971 in Los Angeles.</p>
		<p>Frey and Henley came from humble beginnings after playing back-up to another legend, Linda Ronstadt, 
		and later forming the Eagles when signing with David Geffen’s Asylum Records. 
		Their sound would go on to successfully blend rock and country － something others tried but was mastered by the Eagles. 
		The band released some of the most popular songs of the 1970s："Take It Easy", 
		written by Frey and Jackson Browne, is irresistible with Frey singing lead and the band’s harmonies intact, 
		and "Hotel California", the moody soft rock track, is a classic.</p>
		<p>In 1998, the Eagles were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. 
		A year after that, the Recording Industry Association of America named the Eagles to its list of Artists of the Century, 
		alongside the Beatles, Elvis Presley, Barbra Streisand, Elton John and Garth Brooks.</p>
